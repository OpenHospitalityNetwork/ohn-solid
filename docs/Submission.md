### Definitions

- **hospitality exchange (hospex) community**: A community of people who want to offer each other (free) accommodation, meet in reality, and more.
- **offer**: Accommodation that one member of a hospex community (host) offers to others (guests).

### Motivation

Members of hospitality exchange communities have a problem. Once, they joined a hospitality exchange network. They enjoyed interactions with other members in real world and had a jolly good time. It was a cozy community, run by volunteers.

But then something happened. Mindset of the people in control changed. Suddenly, the access to the community got hidden behind a paywall. Directors started disowning the volunteers and their work. Things got rather grim.

So the members flocked to another community. And then another. They ended up with 5 accounts for 5 different communities.

Then, [Open Hospitality Network](https://openhospitality.network) enters the scene. ([Read about them!](https://openhospitality.network)) They're trying to decentralize and federate hospitality exchange.

And here we are, implementing hospitality exchange with [Solid](https://solidproject.org).
