## Data Security

Please be aware that this project is in alpha, unstable, in active development.

As such, it is not secure, it can break, and your data can stop working and you may need to start all over again.

In particular, **your hospex document (includes location and description of your offer!) is currently made public**, due to unresolved [limitations of permissions granting between solid servers](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/can-i-use-a-non-public-group-to-define-access-to-my-resources/4841).
